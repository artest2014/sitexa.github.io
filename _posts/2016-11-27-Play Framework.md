title: Play Framework - The High Velocity Web Framework
category: 'technology'

The Play Framework combines productivity and performance making it easy to build scalable web applications with Java and Scala. Play is developer friendly with a "just hit refresh" workflow and built-in testing support. With Play, applications scale predictably due to a stateless and non-blocking architecture. By being RESTful by default, including assets compilers, JSON & WebSocket support, Play is a perfect fit for modern web & mobile applications.

## 1,Install Play Framework

### Install Play with SBT

We provide a number of sample projects that have an ./sbt launcher in the local directory. These can be found on our download page. This launcher will automatically download dependencies without you having to install SBT ahead of time.

    ./sbt

####    Running Play with SBT

SBT provides all the necessary commands to run your application. You can use sbt run to run your app.

    sbt run


###  Installing Play with Activator

Activator is a wrapper for SBT that provides a nice graphical user interface and access to a library of third-party templates. Some new users prefer this interface to just using SBT. Note that since Activator is a wrapper for SBT, any commands referencing the sbt command can also be used with the activator command.
