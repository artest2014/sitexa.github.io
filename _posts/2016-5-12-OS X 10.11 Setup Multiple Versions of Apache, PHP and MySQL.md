In the first part, we will walk you through setting up and configuring the OS X built-in Apache and multiple PHP versions.
In the second part, we will cover MySQL, Apache virtual hosts, APC caching, and Xdebug installation.

## Defaut Apache and Php ##

OS X 10.11 El Capitan comes with the Apache 2.4 pre-installed. By default, the document root is configured as
/Library/WebServer/Documents. As this is a development machine, let's assume we want to change the document root to point
to a folder in our own home directory. To do this, we will need to edit Apache's configuration file.

    /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

-   change *DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"* to *DocumentRoot "/Users/your_user/Sites"*
-   change *AllowOverride None* to *AllowOverride All* in section **<Directory "/Users/your_user/Sites">**
-   change **User** from *_www* to *your_user*, **Group** from *_www* to *staff*
-   add the following:

    ```
    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </FilesMatch>
    ```

-   change the following from

    ```
    <IfModule dir_module>
        DirectoryIndex index.html
    </IfModule>
    ```

    to

    ```
    <IfModule dir_module>
        DirectoryIndex index.html index.php
    </IfModule>
    ```
