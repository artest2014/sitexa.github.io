UIKit - A lightweight and modular front-end framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.

#   Core

UIkit offers over 30 modular and extendible components, which can be combined with each other. Components are divided into different compartments according to their purpose and functionality.

##  Defaults

These components generally normalize HTML elements for cross browser functionality and add some very basic styling.

##  Layout

Apply our fully responsive fluid grid system and panels, common layout parts like blog articles and comments and useful utility classes.

##  Navigations

UIkit offers different types of navigations, like navigation bars and side navigations. Use breadcrumbs or a pagination to steer through articles.

##  Elements

Style basic HTML elements, like tables and forms. These components use their own classes. They won't interfere with any default element styling.

##  Common

Here you'll find components that you often use within your content, like buttons, icons, badges, overlays, animations and much more.

##  JavaScript

These components rely mostly on JavaScript to fade in hidden content, like dropdowns, modal dialogs, off-canvas bars and tooltips.
