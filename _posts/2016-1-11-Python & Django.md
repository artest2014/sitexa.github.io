## Python

Python is powerful... and fast; 
plays well with others; 
runs everywhere; 
is friendly & easy to learn; 
is Open.
These are some of the reasons people who use Python would rather not use anything else.

## Django

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Thanks for checking it out.

All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. If you're just getting started, here's how we recommend you read the docs:

-   First, read docs/intro/install.txt for instructions on installing Django.
-   Next, work through the tutorials in order (docs/intro/tutorial01.txt, docs/intro/tutorial02.txt, etc.).
-   If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read docs/howto/deployment/index.txt for instructions.
-   You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in docs/topics) next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in docs/howto) for specific problems, and check out the reference (docs/ref) for gory details.
-   See docs/README for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.


## Django-rest-framework

Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

-   The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
-   Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
-   Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
-   Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
-   Extensive documentation, and great community support.
-   Used and trusted by large companies such as Mozilla and Eventbrite.

REST framework requires the following:

-   Python (2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5)
-   Django (1.7+, 1.8, 1.9)

The following packages are optional:

-   Markdown (2.1.0+) - Markdown support for the browsable API.
-   django-filter (0.9.2+) - Filtering support.
-   django-crispy-forms - Improved HTML display for filtering.
-   django-guardian (1.1.1+) - Object level permissions support.
