Lot of projects and code collections. Vue.js, creeper, SwipeCellKit, 10billionhongbaos, CreepyCodeCollection,
Two.js, awesome creative coding, urh(universal Radio Hacker), meshbird (distributed private netsworking ),
evilpass( password strength checker), botpress( sane way of building great bots), etc.

## botpress

 The only sane way of building great bots. https://botpress.io

 Botpress is an open-source bot creation tool written in Javascript. It is powered by a rich set of open-source modules built by the community. We like to say that Botpress is like the Wordpress of Chatbots; anyone can create and reuse other people's modules.


##  evilpass

Checks how strong your user's password is via questionably ethical means.

##  meshbird

Distributed private networking http://meshbird.com

Meshbird enables distributed private networking across geographically dispersed datacenters. With Meshbird senders can send data directly to recipients without the need for gateways or centralized servers. Furthermore, Meshbird encrypts all traffic using industry standard encryption techniques such as AES-256. Meshbird is compatible across countries, cloud providers, and container technologies.

##  vuejs

A progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building UI on the web. http://vuejs.org

Vue.js is a library for building interactive web interfaces. It provides data-reactive components with a simple and flexible API. Core features include:

-   Declarative rendering with a plain JavaScript object based reactivity system.
-   Component-oriented development style with tooling support
-   Lean and extensible core
-   Flexible transition effect system
-   Fast without the need for complex optimization

Universal Radio Hacker: investigate wireless protocols like a boss

The Universal Radio Hacker is a software for investigating unknown wireless protocols. Features include

-   hardware interfaces for common Software Defined Radios
-   easy demodulation of signals
-   assigning participants to keep overview of your data
-   customizable decodings to crack even sophisticated encodings like CC1101 data whitening
-   assign labels to reveal the logic of the protocol
-   fuzzing component to find security leaks
-   modulation support to inject the data back into the system

##  CreepyCodeCollection

Here we are talking about creepiest of the most creepy codes. Programs, behave so strange, that they will twist your brain. Snippets, so small, that you won’t believe their functionality. And codes, so cryptic, that even the top coders will think of going back to the college.
