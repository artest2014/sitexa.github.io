### Desktop

The popularity of Linux on standard desktop computers and laptops has been increasing over the years. 
Most modern distributions include a graphical user environment, with, as of February 2015, the two most popular 
environments being the KDE Plasma Desktop and Xfce.

### Netbooks

Linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market, with many devices such as the ASUS Eee PC and Acer 
Aspire One shipping with customized Linux distributions installed.

### Servers, mainframes and supercomputers

Linux distributions are the cornerstone of the LAMP server-software combination (Linux, Apache, MariaDB/MySQL, 
Perl/PHP/Python) which has achieved popularity among developers, and which is one of the more common platforms for 
website hosting.

Linux distributions have become increasingly popular on mainframes in the last decade partly due to pricing and the 
open-source model. 

Linux distributions are also most commonly used as operating systems for supercomputers; in the decade since Earth Simulator
 supercomputer, all the fastest supercomputers have used Linux. 

### Smart devices

Several operating systems for smart devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, smart TVs, and in-vehicle infotainment 
(IVI) systems, are based on Linux. Major platforms for such systems include Android, Firefox OS, Mer and Tizen.
 
### Embedded devices

Due to its low cost and ease of customization, Linux is often used in embedded systems. In the non-mobile telecommunications
 equipment sector, the majority of customer-premises equipment (CPE) hardware runs some Linux-based operating system. 
 OpenWrt is a community driven example upon which many of the OEM firmwares are based.
